# Arctic-Cultural-ES
This project maps cultural ecosystem services in Norway, using data collected using PPGIS.   
Project lead **Vera Hausner** Associate Professor, Department of Arctic and Marine Biology, The Arctic University of Tromso vera.hausner@uit.no  
Project associate **Claire Runge** Postdoctoral Research Scholar, National Centre for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, University of California Santa Barbara runge@nceas.ucsb.edu  

This project draws on spatial mapping and prediction tools commonly used in ecology to map and model the spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services across Norway & the Arctic.

###Cultural ES data
Information on the 'occurrence' of cultural ecosystem services is drawn from data collected from ~1000 participants across Norway, and consists of a range of ecosystem values & places, and preference for different management/development options.  

More information on the dataset can be found here:

###Modelling approach
Maxent https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/ is used for spatial mapping & prediction
