#Data procesing notes

##########PPGIS data
originally this data is in WGS84 (Google Earth)
loaded to arcgis, converted to 
-> PPGIS_Markers_south.shp & PPGIS_Markers_north.shp
projected to ETRS_1989_UTM_Zone_33N saved as 
-> PPGIS_Markers_south_UTM33N.shp & PPGIS_Markers_north_UTM33N.shp
clip to alpine climate zone
-> PPGIS_Markers_south_UTM33N_alpine.shp & PPGIS_Markers_north_UTM33N_alpine.shp
...this excludes 8726/9149= 4.6% and 9203/10222=10.0% of the data

#########Spatial data

Clip to Norway_border_10kmbuffer.shp & dissolve
-> Norway_alpine.shp
...note that this shp has been oversimplified and many coastal islands are missing

#Protected areas and Ecologically important regions
Norway protected areas\Protected area Norway Svalbard.shp (use all IUCN categories)
(in ArcGIS) Added integer field "IUCNCat" (1-6=IUCN Ia to IUCN VI, 7=no IUCN category)
(in r ArcticCulturalES_createInputs.r)
Converted to raster using Norway_template_raster as template. Value =1-7
-> Protected_areas_norway.tif

NATURBASE/Naturtyper_flater.shp (use all categories; "VERDI" Localt viktig=locally important; Viktig=Important; Svaert viktig=very important)
(in ArcGIS) Added integer field VERDIint Localt viktig=10; Viktig=20; Svaert viktig=30
(in r ArcticCulturalES_createInputs.r) 
as many of the polygons are very small, buffered by 49m. This should be enough so the polygon overlaps the raster cell centre if the polygon falls within the raster cell, but not so much that polygons that don't overlap a raster cell are assigned to that cell.
Converted to raster using Norway_template_raster as template. Value =10,20,30
-> Ecological_areas_norway.tif

#State land
Statskog eiendom/Statskog eiendom 2014 (use only categories EKAT=2 or 3)
(in r ArcticCulturalES_createInputs.r)
Converted to raster using Norway_template_raster as template. Value =2,3
-> State_commons_norway.tif

#Data that is already rasterized
(in r ArcticCulturalES_createInputs.r)
resampled to Norway_template_raster.
